Privacy Policy for Carstvo Životinja
This Privacy Policy describes how Carstvo Životinja (the “App”) collects, uses, and protects information. The App is an educational and entertaining quiz game intended for children, and we are committed to protecting their privacy.
1. Data We Do Not Collect
Carstvo Životinja is designed to be safe and does not collect any personal data from children or users. This includes, but is not limited to:
    • Name and surname
    • Address
    • Phone number
    • Email address
    • Photos or videos
    • Geolocation
    • Any other data that could identify an individual
2. Data We May Collect
The only data we may collect is anonymous usage statistics. This data is completely anonymous and is used solely to improve the App's functionality, such as:
    • The number of times the App is launched
    • Duration of use
    • Which quizzes are most frequently played
    • Device information (e.g., device type and operating system version)
This data is not linked to individuals and cannot be used to identify them.
3. Advertising
Our App displays advertisements through the Google AdMob service. Google may collect anonymized data to serve contextual ads, which are relevant to the App's content and not to the user. We note that we use Google's solutions for ads intended for families (Google Play's Families Policy), which are compliant with laws on the protection of children's privacy (such as COPPA in the US).
These ads do not use personal data for targeting and will not display interest-based advertisements.
4. Third-Party Services
In our App, we use standard analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics for Firebase) to track anonymous usage statistics. We also use Google AdMob to display ads. These tools collect only the anonymized data mentioned in sections 2 and 3 and cannot be used to identify users.
5. Data Security
We are dedicated to data protection. All anonymous data is secured with appropriate technical and organizational measures.
6. Parental Consent
Since we do not collect personal data, parental consent is not required for the use of our App. However, we recommend that parents supervise their children's use of mobile devices.
7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page.
